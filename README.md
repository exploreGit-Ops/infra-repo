# Infra Repo

This repo is a part of the [VMWare Explore talk](https://event.vmware.com/flow/vmware/explore2023lv/content/page/catalog?tab.contentcatalogtabs=1627421929827001vRXW&search=code2900LV) on creating developer ready K8s clusters using TMC and GitOps. This repo holds all of the terraform, and infra level flux configurations.


This repo pairs with the flux multi-tenant repo [here]() it will provision all of the necessary TMC objects that are outlined the readme of that repo. Combining the two means that you can now run an ADO pipeline that will create setup all of the policy, IAM, flux, clusters, workspaces, clustergroups etc. and immediately be able to use the multitenant repo on those clusters.
## Pre-reqs

* install the [Terraform Task](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.custom-terraform-tasks) in your ADO organization
* [create a service connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#create-a-service-connection) for your azure subscription in ADO. This will be used in the azure pipelines yaml. 

## Create the Azure backend for Terraform

1. login

```bash
az login
```

2. setup env vars for the resources we will create.

```bash
export RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME='tfstate-explore'
export STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="tfstate01explore"
export CONTAINER_NAME='tfstate'
```

3. create the resources
```bash
# Create resource group
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location eastus

# Create storage account
az storage account create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --sku Standard_LRS --encryption-services blob

# Create blob container
az storage container create --name $CONTAINER_NAME --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME

```

## Create the Azure Keyvault for Terraform secrets

We need a place to store secrets and retrieve them when using TF. for example the TMC API key.

1. create a resource group 

```bash 
az group create --name keyvaults --location eastus
```

2. create a keyvault

```bash
az keyvault create --name "explore-gitops" --resource-group "keyvaults" --location "EastUS"

```

3. get the SP that was created for your service connection in the pre-reqs. this can be found by looking at the service connection in ADO and clicking the link to "manage service prinipal" use that name to get the object ID

```bash
az ad sp list --display-name "service-connection-sp-name"
```

4. assign permissions to the sp on the keyvault


```bash
az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Secrets User" --assignee {object id from output above} --scope /subscriptions/{subscriptionid}/resourcegroups/keyvaults/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/explore-gitops

```

## Create the initial secrets

We need secrets some initial secrets for bootstrapping the cluster prior to flux taking over.

### TMC credentials

These will be used for pulling the cluster kubeconfig and also any cli commands we need to run with TF that the provider doesn't currently support.

1. create the TMC secrets in the previously created vault

```bash
#the endpoint should just be the tmc hostname without the https://
az keyvault secret set --vault-name "explore-gitops" --name "tmc-endpoint" --value "<tmc-endpoint>"
az keyvault secret set --vault-name "explore-gitops" --name "tmc-api-key" --value "<tmc-api-key>"
```

2. create the azure client id and secret entries. these will be used to bootstrap the cluster so that external secrets can be used in the cluster. see [here](https://github.com/warroyo/flux-tmc-multitenant/blob/main/README.md#secret-tenancy) for more details about why we do this. This would be equivalent of the secret that is put into the `bootstrap/azure-secret.yaml`

```bash
az keyvault secret set --vault-name "explore-gitops" --name "akv-client-id" --value "<client-id>"
az keyvault secret set --vault-name "explore-gitops" --name "akv-client-secret" --value "<client-secret>"
```


## Execute the pipelines

### Create the tenant workspaces pipeline

Becuase ADO only picks up one pipeline automatically we need to add a second one manually. This only needs to happen once. The reason for this second pipeline is to keep seperate  terraform state for adding tenants.

In the ADO UI, go to the pipelines section and choose new pipeline and github as the source. Then choose this repo and use an existing pipeline file. the file you want to use is `terraform/workspaces/azure-pipelines-tenant.yml` . After choosing this the pipeline will be created.


The pipeline with do the following:

1. terraform validate
2. terraform plan
3. terraform apply

### Excecute the main infra pipeline

With the above pieces done we can now commit the code and let the ADO pipeline run. This is the main pipeline so ADO picks it up automatically.

The pipeline with do the following:

1. terraform validate
2. terraform plan
3. terraform apply



## Repo Structure

This repo has two main folder structures. Here they are defined below

### Infra Terraform

This is in the main terraform folder. This handles creation of core TMC infra: cluster , policy, roles, cluster groups, CICD, etc. This folder has a bit in it so we will break it down by section.

#### Cluster groups & clusters

The cluster groups top level folder contains a folder for each cluster group. That folder hold any TF resources that apply to that group. It also contains a nested folder called `clusters` which has a file per cluster in that cluster group.

```
├── clustergroups
│   ├── <group-name>
│   │   ├── clusters
│   │   │   ├── <cluster-x-name>.tf
│   │   │   └── variables.tf
│   │   ├── git-repo.tf
│   │   ├── kustomization.tf
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── policies.tf
│   │   └── provider.tf
```





#### Modules

All modules that are re-usuable go here. In the case of this repo, there are modules for cluster creation, policy creation, IAM policy and others. 

```
├── modules
│   ├── <module-name>
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── provider.tf
│   │   └── variables.tf
```
#### Policies & IAM

The `polcies` folder contains the policy bindings, they are terraform templates so they can be re-used per cluster group

```
├── policies
│   ├── enforce-es-naming.tftpl
│   └── enforce-sa.tftpl
```


The `policies_templates` folder holds a nested folder that contains the actual templates for custom policies as well as the TF that applies them.
```
├── policy_templates
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── templates
│   │   ├── enforce-es-naming-template.yaml
│   │   └── enforce-sa-template.yaml
│   └── variables.tf
```


The `iam_roles` folder contains the terraform to create new iam roles as well as the actual role yaml in the nested roles folder. 
```
├── iam_roles
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── roles
│   │   ├── cluster-admin-equiv-iam.yaml
│   │   └── tmcnamespaces-iam.yaml
│   └── variables.tf
```

### Tenant Terraform

This is in the `terraform/workspaces` folder. This handles creating workspaces for tenants and the IAM permissions. In this directory there is a file per tenant.


```
└── workspaces
    ├── azure-pipelines-tenant.yml
    ├── iris-blue.tf
    ├── iris-green.tf
    ├── iris-red.tf
    ├── provider.tf
    └── variables.tf
```
